Today I'm feeling down. I go to Binance Square and all I see is: "Free mining", "Claim this", "Claim that", "From the free LTC site, I made the six time withdrawal today", "Earn an Airdrop of $5,000 to $20,000 effortlessly by mining on your smartphone", "Best Mining Website", "Claiming your ETHFI tokens ... donâ€™t miss out on this lucrative airdrop", "Looking for an effortless way to make some extra cash? Check out this...", or "Do NOT miss this launch the next PEPE, do this ... ", "GET daily easy 1000 points claim ... ", "Don't miss free ... free mining opportunity ..."

ðŸ“Œ Help me and help yourself STOP these beings who spread false things, they will make you lose money, time, and above all, they will tie you to false beliefs that you will make money when in reality, nothing will happen.

ðŸ“Œ When you're on mobile, next to the "follow" button for each post, you have like "three vertical dots", I'll send you the screenshot so you can notice it. From there, you can block the people trying to deceive you, but you can also help Binance Square become a clean and safe place by using the REPORT option! And after reporting, Binance gives you the option to block those people.

ðŸ“Œ Don't do it for me, do it for all the users of Binance Square.

I'm sure the bad guys won't like this post, and they'll report and block me... but Binance also penalizes those who make false reports. 

ðŸ“Œ So ... if you're one of the bad guys, think twice before reporting my posts, they are #educational and guides for the good people who want to enhance their knowledge in cryptocurrency investments.
